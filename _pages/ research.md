I am a mathematical economist with strong interests in applications. The topics I have worked on include

- [the impossibility of canonical macroeconomic models to explain wealth inequality](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2019.04.001),
- [a simple explanation for the saving behavior of the rich that does not rely on ad hoc utility functions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2021.105193),
- [a computational algorithm for solving macroeconomic models with realistic wealth distributions](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE1817),
- [simple formula and mathematical foundation for Pareto exponents that arise in random multiplicative processes in Markovian environments](https://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA17984),
- [verification of the random multiplicative process to explain the spread of COVID-19](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physd.2020.132649),
- [wealth inequality and stock market returns](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhz121),
- [determination of academic salaries](https://econjwatch.org/articles/publications-citations-position-and-compensation-of-economics-professors),
- [implication of financial development to international capital flows and welfare](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.08.011),
- [efficient discretization of non-linear, non-Gaussian Markov processes](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE737),
- [optimal epidemic control when testing and government enforcement are imperfect](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2022.105570),

among others.
